            A story about cats
        </h3>
        <p>
            Midnight. Not a sound from the pavement. Suddenly an explosion of music and lights reveals a larger-than-life junkyard. Probing car lights tear across the darkened landscape of bottles and boxes, briefly catching the darting image of a running cat. Tonight
            is the one special night each year when the tribe of Jellicle Cats reunites to celebrate who they are. They emerge singing of their unique abilities and special traits. The cats are at first suspicious and proud, reluctant to allow an audience
            into their domain. In The Naming of Cats, however, they begin to reveal themselves and that cats have three different names: the one the family uses daily, a more dignified name, and a secret name. It is the contemplation of these secret names
            that keeps felines deep in thought.

            Victoria , a young white cat, dances to signal The Invitation To The Jellicle Ball. Munkustrap, a large grey tabby, explains that the Jellicle Cats meet once a year to rejoice. They are waiting for their leader, the wise Old Deuteronomy, who will choose
            which of the Jellicle Cats will journey tonight to the Heaviside layer to be reborn into a new life. And so begins our introduction to the cats. One by one they step forward to audition for the role, to be chosen to make the special journey
            to be reborn. Jennyanydots, The Old Gumbie Cat, sleeps and lounges all day long; Rum Tum Tugger, a playful prankster that the female cats find extremely attractive, and who enjoys being the centre of attention, Grizabella, The Glamour Cat,
            who is shunned by the rest of the tribe despite being a Jellicle Cat and Bustopher Jones, a large “twenty five pounder”, always clad in signature white spats. A thunderous crash and the sound of police sirens will signal that the villainous
            Macavity is on the loose and send the Jellicles scattering!
